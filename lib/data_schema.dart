/// BUSINESS RULES:
/// 
/// 1. A person can belong to only one family
/// 2. A person can have multiple roles
/// 3. A person can have multiple active workflows
/// 4. Family head must be a member of that family
/// 5. Activity logs are immutable once created
/// 6. Soft deletes used (isActive flag) to preserve data integrity
/// 7. All timestamps stored in UTC
/// 8. Profile images stored as base64 data URLs in person documents
/// 9. A service can have only one service sheet
/// 10. A person can be assigned to multiple positions in the same service
/// 11. Position assignments have statuses to track confirmation workflow
/// 12. Service status determines visibility and editability
/// 13. Teams and positions form hierarchical structure
/// 14. Availability constraints are enforced during assignment
/// 15. Event registrations can be linked to persons or external
/// 16. Event forms are customizable with multiple field types
/// 17. Event visibility controls who can see and register
/// 18. Waiting lists automatically promote when space available
/// 19. Forms can have multiple accessibility levels (public, members, groups, roles)
/// 20. Form submissions are linked to persons when authenticated
/// 21. Form fields support conditional logic and validation rules
/// 22. Published forms cannot be deleted, only archived
/// 23. Form submission limits are enforced when specified
/// 24. Test submissions are separate from real submissions
/// 25. File uploads in forms are stored in Firebase Storage
/// 26. Person fields in forms auto-populate for authenticated users
/// 27. Form templates enable quick form creation with predefined structures
/// 
/// PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
/// 
/// 1. Compound indexes optimize common query patterns
/// 2. Arrays used sparingly to avoid document size limits
/// 3. Pagination implemented for large result sets
/// 4. Client-side filtering for text search to avoid index limitations
/// 5. Batch operations used for bulk updates
/// 6. Activity logging is async to avoid blocking main operations
/// 7. Form statistics calculated on-demand to avoid real-time overhead
/// 8. Large form responses paginated for better performance
/// 9. File uploads handled asynchronously with progress tracking
/// 10. Form field validation performed client-side before submission
/// 11. Template loading cached to reduce database queries
